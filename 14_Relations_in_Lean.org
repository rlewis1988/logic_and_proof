* Relations in Lean
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Relations_in_Lean
:END:      

In first-order logic, a (binary) relation was defined to be a set of
pairs of elements of the domain. We adopted a similar definition in
informal mathematics, although we've tended to use infix notation for
relation symbols and have mostly ignored the "set-membership" definition.
In practice, a (binary) relation was a sort of function that took two
elements of the domain and returned either "true" or "false."

In Lean, we make this notion explicit: a binary relation on a type =A=
is a function =A → A → Prop=. If =R= has this type, and =a b : A=,
then =R a b= is either =True= or =False=.

** Order Relations

We can reason about partial orders in Lean by fixing a type, =A=, and a
binary relation, =R=, and working under the hypotheses that =A= is
reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric:
#+BEGIN_SRC lean
section
  parameters {A : Type} {R : A → A → Prop}
  hypothesis (reflR : reflexive R)
  hypothesis (transR : transitive R)
  hypothesis (antisymmR : ∀ {a b : A}, R a b → R b a → a = b)

  local infix ≤ := R
end
#+END_SRC
The =parameter= and =hypothesis= commands are similar to the
=variable= and =premise= commands, except that parameters are fixed
within a section. In other words, if you prove a theorem about =R= in
the section above, you cannot apply that theorem to another relation,
=S=, without closing the section. Since the parameter =R= is fixed,
Lean allows us to define notation for =R=, to be used locally in the
section. 

In the example below, having fixed a partial order, =R=, we define the
corresponding strict partial order and prove that it is, indeed, a
strict order.

  local infix ≤ := R

  definition R' (a b : A) : Prop := a ≤ b ∧ a ≠ b

  local infix < := R'

  theorem irrefl (a : A) : ¬ a < a :=
  suppose a < a,
  have a ≠ a, from and.right this,
  have a = a, from rfl,
  show false, from `a ≠ a` `a = a`

  theorem trans {a b c : A} (H₁ : a < b) (H₂ : b < c) : a < c :=
  have a ≤ b, from and.left H₁,
  have a ≠ b, from and.right H₁,
  have b ≤ c, from and.left H₂,
  have b ≠ c, from and.right H₂,
  have a ≤ c, from transR `a ≤ b` `b ≤ c`,
  have a ≠ c, from 
    suppose a = c,
      have c ≤ b, from `a = c` ▸ `a ≤ b`,
      have b = c, from antisymmR `b ≤ c` `c ≤ b`,
      show false, from `b ≠ c` `b = c`, 
  show a < c, from and.intro `a ≤ c` `a ≠ c`
end
#+END_SRC

Notice that we have used the command =open eq.ops= to avail ourselves
of the extra notation for equality proofs, so that the expression 
=`a = c` ▸ `a ≤ b`= denotes a proof of =c ≤ b=.
