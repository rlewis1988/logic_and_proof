** The Number Systems

We have already come across some of the fundamental number systems:
the natural numbers, $\NN$, the integers, $\ZZ$, and the rationals,
$\QQ$. In a sense, each subsequent element of the list was designed to
remedy defects in the previous system: we can subtract any integer
from any other integer and end up with another integer, and we can
divide any rational number by a nonzero rational number and end up
with a rational number.

# TODO: eventually the discussion of the algebraic properties should
# go in the algebraic structures chapter

The integers and rationals are instances of /ordered rings/, which is
to say, they satisfy all of the following properties:

- Addition is associative and commutative.
- There is an additive identity, $0$.
- Every element $x$ has an additive inverse, $-x$.
- Multiplication is associative and commutative.
- There is a multiplicative identity, $1$.
- Every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, $1 / x$.
- There is a total order $\leq$.
- For any elements $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x \leq y$ then $x + z \leq
  y + z$.
- For any elements $x$ and $y$, if $0 \leq x$ and $0 \leq y$ then $0
  \leq x * y$.

The set of natural numbers lacks the third property, but satisfies a
weaker set of axioms, making it an /ordered semiring/. The
rational numbers satisfy the additional property that every nonzero
element has a multiplicative inverse, which makes it an /ordered
field/.

It is worth knowing that once we have the natural numbers, it is
possible to /construct/ the integers and rational numbers, using
set-theoretic constructions you have already seen. For example, we can
take an integer to be a pair $(i, n)$ of natural numbers; the idea is
that $(0, n)$ represents the positive integer $n$, and $(1, n)$
represents the negative integer $-(n+1)$. (We use $-(n+1)$ instead of
$-n$ to avoid having two representations of $0$.) With this
definition, the integers are simply $\{0, 1\} \times \NN$. We can then
go on to define the operations of addition and multiplication, the
additive inverse, and the order relation, and prove they have the
desired properties.

This construction has the side effect that the natural numbers
themselves are not integers; for example, we have to distinguish
between the natural number $2$, and the integer $2$. In Lean, for
example, this is the case. In ordinary mathematics, it is common to
think of the natural numbers as a subset of the integers. Once we
construct the integers, however, we can throw away the old version of
the natural numbers, and afterwards identify the natural numbers as
nonnegative integers. 

We can do the same for the rationals, defining them to be the set of
pairs $(a, b)$ in $\ZZ \times \NN$, where either $a = 0$ and $b = 1$,
or $b > 0$ and $a$ and $b$ have no common divisor (other than $1$ and
$-1$). The idea is that $(a, b)$ represents $a / b$. With this
definition, the rationals are really a subset of $\ZZ \times \NN$. We
can then define all the operations accordingly.

# TODO: add chapter reference in the next paragraph

In the next section, we will define a more sophisticated approach, one
which will scale to a definition of the real numbers. And in a later
chapter, we will show how to construct the natural numbers from the
axioms of set theory. This shows that we can construct all the number
systems from the bottom up.

But first, let us pause for a moment to consider why the real numbers
are needed. We have seen that $2$ has no rational square root. This
means, in a sense, that there is a "gap" in the rationals: the are
rationals whose squares are arbitrarily close to 2, but there is no
rational $x$ with the property that $x^2 = 2$. But it seems
intuitively clear that there should be some /number/ with that
property: $\sqrt{2}$ is the length of the diagonal of a square with
side length $1$. Similarly, $\pi$, the area of a circle with radius 1,
is missing from the rationals. These are the kinds of "defects" that
the real numbers are designed to repair.

# TODO: the previous presentation had this. It's confusing; in
# mathematical terms, I don't think the rationals are considered
# discrete or continuous. Anyhow, perhaps the discussion of density
# can do in the chapter on orders? Or algebraic structures?

# Mathematicians often distinguish the /discrete/ from the
# /continuous/. The natural numbers and the integers fall into the
# former category. Roughly speaking, this is because there is "space"
# between any two distinct integers: 0 and 1 are not equal, but there is
# no integer that falls between them. (The study of topology makes this
# distinction more precise.)

# The rational numbers are different. If $a$ and $b$ are distinct
# rationals with $a < b$, then we know that $a < \frac{b - a}{2} <
# b$. Put another way, for any rational $a$, there must be another
# rational arbitrarily close to $a$: for any $\varepsilon \in \QQ$, there
# is a $b \in \QQ$ such that $|a - b| < \varepsilon$. We say that the
# rational numbers are /dense/.

You may be used to thinking of real numbers as (potentially) infinite
decimals: for example, $\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356\ldots$ and $\pi =
3.14159265\ldots$. A central goal of this chapter is to make the "..."
precise. The idea is that we can take an infinite decimal to represent
a sequence of rational approximations. For example, we can approximate
the square root of 2 with the sequence $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, \ldots$.
We would like to define $\sqrt{2}$ to be the "limit" of that sequence,
but we have seen that the sequence does not have a limit in the
rationals. So we have to construct new objects, the real numbers, to
serve that purpose.

In fact, we will define the real numbers, more or less, to /be/ such
sequences of rational approximations. But we will have to deal with
the fact that, for example, there are /lots/ of ways of approximating
the square root of two. The next section will show us how to "glue"
all these sequences together and treat them as a single object.

** Quotient Constructions
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Quotient_Constructions

# TODO: this could be foreshadowed better in the chapter on number
# theory. And maybe it ultimately belongs in the chapter on algebraic
# structures?

# Anyhow, the exposition should be expanded and improved.

Let $A$ be any set, and let $\equiv$ be any equivalence relation on
$A$. Recall from [[file:11_Sets.org::#Sets][Chapter 11]] that we can assign to every element $a$ of
$A$ the equivalence class $[a]$, where $b \in [a]$ means $b \equiv
a$. This assignment has the property that for every $a$ and $b$, $a
\equiv b$ if and only if $[a] = [b]$.

Given any set $A$ and equivalence relation $\equiv$, define the set
\begin{equation*}
A / \equiv = \{ [ a ] \mid a \in A \}
\end{equation*}
of /equivalence classes/ of $A$ modulo $\equiv$. You can think of this
as the set $A$ where equivalent elements are "glued together" to make
a coarser set. 

For example, if we consider the integers $\ZZ$ with $\equiv$ denoting
equivalence modulo 5 (see [[file:19_Elementary_Number_Theory.org::#Elementary_Number_Theory][Chapter 19]]), then $\ZZ / \equiv$ is just
$\{ [0], [1], [2], [3], [4] \}$. We can define addition on $\ZZ /
\equiv$ by $[a] + [b] = [a + b]$. For this definition to make sense,
it is important to know that the right-hand side does not depend on
which representatives of $[a]$ and $[b]$ we choose. In other words, we
need to know that whenever $[a] = [a']$ and $[b] = [b']$, then $[a +
b] = [a' + b']$. This, in turn, is equivalent to saying that if $a
\equiv a'$ and $b \equiv b'$, then $a + b \equiv a' + b'$. And we saw
in [[file:19_Elementary_Number_Theory.org::#Elementary_Number_Theory][Chapter 19]] that this is in fact the case. In this case, we say that
the operation of addition /respects/ equivalence modulo 5, and that we
have /extended/ the operation of addition from $\ZZ$ to $\ZZ /
\equiv$.

To construct the integers, start with $\NN \times \NN$. Think of the
pair of natural numbers $(m, n)$ as representing $m - n$, when we view
$m$ and $n$ as integers. For example, both $(2, 5)$ and $(6, 9)$
represent the integer $-3$. Intuitively, the pairs $(m, n)$ and $(m',
n')$ will represent the same integer when $m - n = m' - n'$, but we do
not have the right operation of subtraction, since we haven't
constructed the integers. But the equation is equivalent to $m + n' =
m' + n$, and /this/ makes sense with addition on the natural numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Define the relation $\equiv$ on $\NN \times
\NN$ by $(m, n) \equiv (m', n')$ if and only if $m + n' = m' + n$.

*Proposition.* $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation.

*Proof.* For reflexivity, it is clear that $(m, n) \equiv (m, n)$,
since $m + n = m + n$.

For symmetry, suppose $(m, n) \equiv (m', n')$. This means $m + n' =
m' + n$. But the symmetry of equality implies $(m', n') \equiv (m,
n)$, as required.

For transitivity, suppose $(m, n) \equiv (m', n')$, and $(m', n') =
(m'', n'')$. Then we have $m + n' = m' + n$ and $m' + n'' = n' +
m''$. Adding these equations, we get
\begin{equation*}
m + n' + m' + n'' = m' + n + n' + m''.
\end{equation*}
Subtracting $m' + n'$ from both sides, we get $m + n'' = n + m''$,
which is equivalent to $(m', n') = (m'', n'')$, as required.

#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

We can now define the integers to be $\NN \times \NN / \equiv$. How
should we define addition? If $[(m, n)]$ represents $m - n$, and $[(u,
v)]$ represents $u - v$, then $[(m, n)] + [(u, v)]$ should represent $(m +
u) - (n + v)$. Thus, it makes sense to define $[(m, n)] + [(u, v)]$ to be
$[(m + u) - (n + v)]$. For this to work, we need to know that the
operation which sends $(m, n)$ and $(u, v)$ to $(m + u, n + v)$
respects the equivalence relation.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Proposition.* If $(m, n) \equiv (m', n')$ and $(u, v) \equiv (u',
v')$, then $(m + u, n + v) \equiv (m' + u', n' + v')$.

*Proof.* The first equivalence means $m + n' = m' + n$, and the second
means $u + v' = u' + v$. Adding the two equations, we get $(m + u) +
(n' + v') \equiv (m' + u') + (n + v)$, which is exactly the same as
saying $(m + u, n + v) \equiv (m' + u', n' + v')$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Every natural number $n$ can be represented by the integer $[(n, 0)]$,
and, in particular, $0$ is represented by $[(0, 0)]$. Moreover, if
$[(m, n)]$ is any integer, we can define its negation to be $[(n,
m)]$, since $[(m, n)] + [(n, m)] = [(m + n, n + m)] = [(0, 0)]$, since
$(m + n, n + m) \equiv (0, 0)$. In short, we have "invented" the
negative numbers!

We could go on this way to define multiplication and the ordering on
the integers, and prove that they have the desired properties. We
could also carry out a similar construction for the rational
numbers. Here, we would start with the set $\ZZ \times \ZZ^{>0}$,
where $\ZZ^{>0}$ denotes the strictly positive integers. The idea, of
course, is that $(a, b)$ represents $(a / b)$. With that in mind, it
makes sense to define $(a, b) \equiv (c, d)$ if $a d = b c$. We could
go on to define addition, multiplication, and the ordering there,
too. The details are tedious, however, and not very illuminating. So
we turn, instead, to a construction of the real numbers.

# TODO: we can use the text below to add more information about the
# rationals.

# A rational number consists of a numerator and a nonzero
# denominator. It's tempting, then, to define the set $\QQ$ to be the
# set of ordered pairs $\langle n, d \rangle$, where $n \in \ZZ$ and
# $d \in \NN^+$ (the set of positive natural numbers). But this
# contains "repeat" elements: $\langle 1, 2 \rangle$ and $\langle 2, 4
# \rangle$ are different sets but represent the same rational
# number. For now, we will call this set of pairs $Q$.

# We say that $\langle n_1, d_1 \rangle$ and $\langle n_2, d_2
# \rangle$ are /equivalent/ if $n_1 \cdot (d_2 + 1) = n_2 \cdot (d_1 +
# 1)$. For $p \in Q$, the /equivalence class/ of $p$ is the set $\{q
# \in Q : p \text{ and } q \text{ are equivalent} \}$. Notice that an
# equivalence class is simply a subset of $Q$ whose elements represent
# the same rational number, and that every pair which represents this
# rational number is an element of that equivalence class.  We define
# $\QQ$ to be the set of all such equivalence classes in $Q$.

# This process is known as taking the /quotient/ of a set with respect
# to an equivalence relation, and appears quite frequently in
# mathematics. There is a similar operation allowed in type theory: to
# define the type rat, we take the quotient of the type $bool \times
# nat$ with respect to the appropriate equivalence relation.

** Constructing the Real Numbers

The problem we face is that the sequence $1, 1.4, 1.41, 1.414, 1.4142,
\ldots$ of rational numbers seems to approach a value that /would/ be
the square root of 2, but there is no rational number that can play
that role. The next definition captures the notion that this sequence
of numbers "seems to approach a value," without referring to a value
that it is approaching.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* A sequence of rational numbers $(q_i)_{i \in \NN}$ is
/Cauchy/ if for every rational number $\varepsilon > 0$, there is some
natural number $N \in \NN$ such that for all $i, j \geq N$, we have
that $|q_i - q_j| < \varepsilon$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Roughly speaking, a Cauchy sequence is one where the elements become
arbitrarily close, not just to their successors but to all following
elements. It is common in mathematics to use $\varepsilon$ to represent
a quantity that is intended to denote something small; you should read
the phrase "for every $\varepsilon > 0$" as saying "no matter how
small $\varepsilon$ is." So a sequence is Cauchy if, for any
$\varepsilon > 0$, no matter how small, there is some point $N$,
beyond which the elements stay within a distance of $\varepsilon$ of
one another.

# This next part doesn't make sense: we haven't said what
# 1.412... means. We are presenting a construction of the reals, and
# it is circular, misleading, and confusing to say that the square
# root of two is the Cauchy sequence that approximates the square root
# of two.

# #+HTML: <hr>
# #+LATEX: \horizontalrule

# *Lemma.* The sequence defined above to approximate $\sqrt{2}$ is Cauchy.

# *Proof.* First, we note that if $i \leq j$, we know that $q_i \leq
# *q_j$, and $q_j - q_i < \frac{1}{10^i}$. This # is true because
# *$q_i$ and $q_j$ match through the $i$ th decimal place.

# Let $\varepsilon$ be an arbitrary rational number, and let $N$ be a
# natural number such that $\frac{1}{10^N} < \varepsilon$. (Since
# $\varepsilon > 0$, such an $N$ must exist.) Take $i$ and $j$ such
# that $i, j \geq N$, and suppose without loss of generality that $i
# \leq j$. Then \[ |q_i - q_j| = q_j - q_i < \frac{1}{10^i} \leq
# \frac{1}{10^N} < \varepsilon. \]

# #+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Cauchy sequences can be used to describe these gaps in the rationals,
but many Cauchy sequences can be used to describe the same gap. For
instance, a sequence $2, 1.5, 1.42, \ldots$ can approach the same
value as our $1, 1.4, 1.41, \ldots$, but from above instead of from
below. It is slightly misleading to say that they "approach the same
point," since there is no rational point that they approach; a more
precise statement is that the sequences eventually become arbitrarily
close.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Two Cauchy sequences $p = (p_i)_{i \in \NN}$ and $q =
(q_i)_{i \in \NN}$ are /equivalent/ if for every rational number
$\varepsilon > 0$, there is some natural number $N \in \NN$ such that
for all $i \geq N$, we have that $|p_i - q_i| < \varepsilon$. We write
$p \equiv q$.

*Proposition.* $\equiv$ is an equivalence relation on
Cauchy sequences.

*Proof.* Reflexivity and symmetry are easy, so let us prove
transitivity. Suppose $(p_i) \equiv (q_i)$ and $(q_i) \equiv
(r_i)$. We want to show that the sequence $(q_i)$ is equivalent to
$(r_i)$. So, given any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $N_0$ large enough
such that for every $i \ge N_0$, $|p_i - q_i| < \varepsilon /
2|$. Choose another number, $N_1$, so that for every $i \geq
N_1$, $|q_i - r_i| < \varepsilon / 2$. Let $N = \max(N_0, N_1)$. Then
for every $i \geq N$, we have
\begin{equation*}
 |p_i - r_i | = |(p_i - q_i) + (q_i - r_i)| \leq |p_i - q_i| + |q_i - r_i| 
  \leq \varepsilon / 2 + \varepsilon / 2 = \varepsilon,
\end{equation*}
as required.

Notice that the proof uses the triangle inequality: for any rational
numbers $a$ and $b$, $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$. (The triangle
inequality will also be true of the real numbers, once we are done
constructing them.)

We now let $A$ be the set of Cauchy sequences of rationals, and
define the real numbers, $\RR$, to be $A / \equiv$. In other words,
the real numbers are the set of Cauchy sequence of rationals, modulo
the equivalence relation we just defined.

Having the set $\RR$ by itself is not enough: we also would like to
know how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. As with
the integers, we need to define operations on the underlying set, and
then show that they respect the equivalence relation. For example, we
will say how to add Cauchy sequences of rationals, and then show that
if $p_1 \equiv p_2$ and $q_1 \equiv q_2$, then $p_1 + q_1 \equiv p_2 +
q_2$. We can then lift this definition to $\RR$ by defining $[p] +
[q]$ to be $[p + q]$.

Luckily, it is easy to define addition, subtraction, and
multiplication on Cauchy sequences. If $p = (p_i)_{i \in \NN}$ and $q
= (q_i)_{i \in \NN}$ are Cauchy sequences, let $p + q = (p_i + q_i)_{i
\in \NN}$ and similarly for subtraction and multiplication. It is
trickier to show that these sequences are Cauchy themselves, and to
show that the operations have the appropriate algebraic properties. We
ask you to prove this for addition in the exercises.

We can identify each rational number $q$ with the constant Cauchy
sequence $q, q, q, \ldots$, so the real numbers include all the
rationals. The next step is to abstract away the details of the
particular construction we have chosen, so that henceforth we can work
with the real numbers abstractly, and no longer think of them as given
by equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rationals.

** The Completeness of the Real Numbers

We constructed the real numbers to fill in "gaps" in the rationals.
How do we know that we have got them all? Perhaps we need to construct
even more numbers, using Cauchy sequences of reals? The next theorem
tells us that, on the contrary, there is no need to extend the reals
any further in this way.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* A sequence $(r_i)_{i \in \NN}$ of real numbers
/converges/ if there is a real number $r$ such that, for every
$\varepsilon > 0$, there is an $N$ such that for every $i \geq N$,
$|r_i - r| < \varepsilon$. 

*Theorem.* Every Cauchy sequence of real numbers converges.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

The statement of the theorem is often expressed by saying that the
real numbers are /complete/.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* An element $u \in \RR$ is said to be an /upper bound/ to
a subset $S \subseteq \RR$ if everything in $S$ is less
than or equal to $u$. $S$ is said to be /bounded/ if there is an upper
bound to $S$. An element $u$ is said to be a /least upper bound/ to
$S$ if it is an upper bound to $S$, and nothing smaller than $u$ is an
upper bound to $S$.

*Theorem.* Let $S$ be a bounded, nonempty subset of $\RR$. Then $S$
has a least upper bound.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

The rational numbers do not have this property: if we set $S = \{x \in
\QQ \mid x^2 < 2\}$, then the rational number 2 is an upper bound for
$S$, but $S$ has no least upper bound in $\QQ$.

# TODO: prove the theorems!

# TODO: in the next paragraph, we want to say "isomorphic."

It is a fundamental theorem that the real numbers are characterized
exactly by the property that they are a complete ordered field, such
that every real number $r$ is less than or equal to some natural
number $N$. Any two models that meet these requirements must behave in
exactly the same way, at least insofar as the constants $0$ and $1$,
the operations $+$ and $*$, and the relation $\leq$ are
concerned. This fact extremely powerful because it allows us to avoid
thinking about the Cauchy sequence construction in normal
mathematics. Once we have shown that our construction meets these
requirements, we can take $\RR$ to be "the" unique complete totally
ordered field and ignore any implementation details. We are also free
to implement $\RR$ in any way we choose, and as long as it meets this
interface, and as long as they do not refer to the underlying
representations, any theorems we prove about the reals will hold
equally well for all constructions.

[More needed here.]


** An Alternative Construction

Many sources will use an alternative construction of the reals, taking
them instead to be /Dedekind cuts/. A Dedekind cut is an ordered pair
$\langle A, B \rangle$ of sets of rational numbers with the following
properties:

- Every rational number $q$ is in either $A$ or $B$.
- Each $a \in A$ is less than every $b \in B$.
- There is no greatest element of $A$.
- $A$ and $B$ are both nonempty.

The first two properties show why we call this pair a "cut." The set
$A$ contains all of the rational numbers to the left of some mark on
the number line, and $B$ all of the points to the right. The third
property tells us something about what happens exactly at that mark.
But there are two possibilities: either $B$ has a least element, or it
doesn't. Picturing the situation where $A$ has no greatest element and
$B$ has no least element may be tricky, but consider the example $A =
\{x \in \QQ \mid x^2 < 2\}$ and $B = \{x \in \QQ \mid x^2 > 2\}$.  There is
no rational number $q$ such that $q^2 = 2$, but there are rational
numbers on either side that are arbitrarily close; thus neither $A$
nor $B$ contains an endpoint.

We define $\RR$ to be the set of Dedekind cuts. A Dedekind cut
$(A, B)$ corresponds to a rational number $q$ if $q$ is
the least element of $B$, and to an irrational number if $B$ has no
least element. It is straightforward to define addition on $\RR$:
\begin{equation*}
(A_1, B_1) + (A_2, B_2) = ( \{a_1 + a_2 \mid a_1 \in A_1,
 a_2 \in A_2 \}, \{b_1 + b_2 \mid b_1 \in B_1, b_2 \in B_2 \} )
\end{equation*}

# Multiplication is defined similarly.
# TODO: this isn't really true -- it is more complicated, I think.

Some authors prefer this construction to the Cauchy sequence
construction because it avoids taking the quotient of a set, and thus
removes the complication of showing that arithmetic operations respect
equivalence. Others prefer Cauchy sequences since they provide a
clearer notion of approximation: if a real number $r$ is given by a
Cauchy sequence $(q_i)_{i \in \NN}$, then an arbitrarily close
rational approximation of $r$ is given by $q_N$ for a sufficiently
large $N$.

# TODO: before we said
# "It is a matter of context, or sometimes personal taste, to
# decide which approach to use."
# Maybe later we should say that the two structures are isomorphic?

** Limits and Continuity

[Under construction]

# A good goal here would be to prove the polynomials are continuous. A
# better goal would be to prove the intermediate value theorem. These
# two together would let us (finally) prove that the square root of 2
# exists.

# TODO: on reflection, this just doesn't fit here. It doesn't make
# sense to talk about constructive developments of the reals without
# more information about constructive foundations, and anyhow the
# Cauchy construction above is perfectly constructive. 
#
# At issue is the fact that classically, we can prove that something
# converges without having a computable rate of convergence. But that
# is a separate story, and it needs to be embedded in a discussion of
# computability. (We can add this, for example, to a later chapter.)

# On top of that, as far as effective rates of convergence, there is
# nothing special about 1 / n. That is a reasonable choice for
# formalization and implementation (though for the latter 1/2^n is
# certainly more natural), but anyhow the focus should be effectivity,
# not any particular rate.

# ** Constructive Real Numbers

# A strict constructivist would be upset by this claim about finding arbitrarily close rational
# approximations. Suppose that $q = \{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ is a Cauchy sequence of rationals; for which
# value $N$ is $q_N$ within $\frac{1}{10}$ of the corresponding real? The fact that $q$ is
# Cauchy implies that there is some such $N$, but in general there is no way to compute what it is.
# We could check 1000 terms and confirm that all are within $\frac{1}{100}$ of each other, but
# the 1001st might jump up. The approximation is nonconstructive -- there is /some/ approximation
# $q_N$, but we cannot compute what it is.

# The Cauchy sequence construction looks somewhat different in constructive mathematics, in order
# to ameliorate this kind of problem. Rather than calling a sequence Cauchy if it converges
# /eventually/ (with no a priori information about when), we require that sequences converge at a
# fixed rate.

# #+HTML: <hr>
# #+LATEX: \horizontalrule

# *Definition.* A sequence of rationals $\{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ is /constructively Cauchy/ if for
# all $i, j \in \NN$, we have that $|q_i - q_j| < \frac{1}{i + 1} + \frac{1}{j + 1}$.

# Two constructively Cauchy sequences  $\{p_i\}_{i \in \NN}$, $\{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ are /equivalent/ if
# for all $i \in \NN$, we have that $|p_i - q_i| < \frac{2}{i + 1}$.

# #+HTML: <hr>
# #+LATEX: \horizontalrule

# It is not hard to see that every constructively Cauchy sequence is classically Cauchy. Furthermore,
# if $\{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ is constructively Cauchy, it follows that $q_i$ is within $\frac{1}{i}$
# of its corresponding real number, providing a computable approximation method.

# However, there are still limitations to the constructive approach. For one, defining the 
# arithmetic operations on constructive Cauchy sequences is more difficult. The classical approach
# of adding the sequences piecewise fails, since two constructive Cauchy sequences could sum to
# a non-Cauchy sequence. There is a simple workaround in the case of addition, but for multiplication,
# the workaround is more complicated.

# Defining division is even harder; the reason why has far-reaching consequences. Recall that in
# constructive logic, we cannot prove the statement $p \vee \not p$ for all propositions $p$. This
# is not to say that we can /never/ prove $p \vee \not p$, though; for instance, we can prove
# $\top \vee \not \top$. In fact, for any natural numbers $m$ and $n$, we can prove
# $n = m \vee n \neq m$ constructively. Intuitively, natural numbers contain a finite amount
# of information, and so one can compare two naturals completely in a finite amount of time. 
# The same is not true for the reals. Consider a constructive Cauchy sequence $\{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$
# whose entries are
# decreasing, and compare it to the sequence where every entry is 0. The sequences are equivalent --
# and their corresponding real numbers are equal -- if $|q_i| < \frac{2}{i + 1}$ for all $i \in \NN$.
# But this is infinitary, and we cannot (in general) algorithmically check it. Since division normally
# requires us to know whether the denominator is 0 or not, we must be very careful in setting up
# our definitions.

# The moral is that a real number is a much more complicated kind of object than a natural, an integer,
# or a rational. There is no way to represent an arbitrary real number in finite space or compute
# with it precisely in finite time. Despite an apparent similarity between $\QQ$ and $\RR$ -- both
# are dense, and every real has an arbitrarily close rational -- the real line is more intricate
# than the rational line. We explore this again in a later chapter on cardinality and the infinite.

** Exercises

# TODO: I am getting tired. Many of these need to be spelled out in
# more detail.

1. Show that addition for the integers, as defined in [[#Quotient_Constructions][Section 27.2]], is
   commutative and associative.

2. Show from the construction of the integers in  [[#Quotient_Constructions][Section 27.2]] that
   $a + 0 = a$ for every integers $a$.

3. Define subtraction for the integers by $a - b = a + (-b)$, and
   show that $a - b + b = a$ for every pair of integers $a$ and $b$.

4. Define multiplication for the integers, by first defining it on the
   underlying representation and then showing that the operation
   respects the equivalence relation.

5. Show that every Cauchy sequence is bounded: that is, if $\{q_i\}_{i
   \in \NN}$ is Cauchy, there is some rational $M$ such that $|q_i|
   \leq M$ for all $i$. Hint: try letting $\varepsilon = 1$.

6. Let $p = (p_i)_{i \in \NN}$ and $q = (q_i)_{i \in \NN}$ be Cauchy
   sequences, and define $p + q = (p_i + q_i)_{i \in \NN}, $p*q =
   (p_i * q_i)_{i \in \NN}$.

   a. Show that $p + q$ is Cauchy. That is, for arbitrary $\varepsilon
      > 0$, show that there exists an $N$ such that for all $i, j \geq
      N$, $|(p_i + q_i) - (p_j + q_j)| < \varepsilon$.

   b. Show that $p * q$ is Cauchy. In addition to the triangle
      inequality, you will find the previous exercise useful.

7. These two parts show that addition of Cauchy sequences respects
   equivalence.

   a. Show that if $p, p', q$ are Cauchy sequences and $p \equiv p'$,
      then $p + q \equiv p' + q$.

   b. Argue, using exercise 1 and the first part of this problem, that
      if $p, p', q, q'$ are Cauchy sequences, $p \equiv p'$, and $q
      \equiv q'$, then $p + q \equiv p' + q'$.

8. Show that if $(A_1, B_1)$ and $(A_2, B_2)$ are Dedekind cuts, then
   $(A_1, B_1) + (A_2, B_2)$ is also a Dedekind cut.




# 7. Describe an example of two constructively Cauchy sequences $p =
# \{p_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ and $q = \{q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ such that the sum
# $p + q = \{p_i + q_i\}_{i \in \NN}$ is not constructively
# Cauchy. Give an alternate definition of the sum that makes this
# true.
