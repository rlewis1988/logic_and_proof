** Equinumerosity

Remember that in [[file:21_Combinatorics.org::#Combinatorics][Chapter 21]] we defined, for each natural number $n$,
the set $[n] = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$. We then said that a set $A$ is
said to be /finite/ if there is a bijection between $A$ and $[n]$ for
some $n$. A set is said to be /infinite/ if it is not finite.

If $A$ and $B$ are two finite sets, then they have the same
cardinality if and only if there is a bijection between them. It turns
out that the same notion of "having the same cardinality" makes sense
even if $A$ and $B$ are not finite.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be /equinumerous/, $A
\approx B$, if there is a bijection between them. Equivalently, we say
that $A$ and $B$ /have the same cardinality/.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

At this stage, saying that $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality may
sound strange, because it is not clear that there is any object, "the
cardinality of $A$," that they both "have." It turns out that, in
set-theoretic foundatoins, there are certain objects ---
generalizations of the natural numbers --- that one can use to measure
the size of an infinite set, and which therefore fill the role of the
"cardinality" of a set. But this is irrelevant to our purposes here:
for the rest of this chapter, when we say that $A$ and $B$ have the
same cardinality, we mean neither more nor less than the fact that
there is a bijection between them.

The following theorem says, essentially, the equinumerosity is an
equivalence relation. (The caveat is that so far we have spoke only of
relations between sets, and the collection of all sets is not itself a
set.)

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Proposition*. Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be any sets.
- $A \approx A$.
- If $A \approx B$, then $B \approx A$.
- If $A \approx B$ and $B \approx C$ then $A \approx C$.

The proof is left as an exercise.

** Countably Infinite Sets

The set of natural numbers, $\NN$, is a prototypical example of an
infinite set. To see that it is infinite, suppose, on the other hand,
that it is finite. This means that there is a bijection $f$ between $\NN$
and $[n]$  for some natural number $n$. We can restrict to the subset
$[n+1]$ of $\NN$, and thereby obtain an injective map from $[n+1]$ to
$[n]$. But this violates the pigeonhole principle, proved in [[file:21_Combinatorics.org::#Combinatorics][Chapter 21]].

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* A set $A$ is said to be /countably infinite/ if it is
equinumerous with $\NN$. A set $A$ is said to be /countable/ if it is
finite or countably infinite.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Since the identity map $id(x) = x$ is a bijection on any set, every
set is equinumerous with itself, and thus $\NN$ itself is countably
infinite.

The term "countably infinite" is meant to be evocative. Suppose $A$ is
a countable set. By definition, there is a bijection $f : \NN \to
A$. $A$ has a "first" element, $f(0)$, a "second" element, $f(1)$, a
"third" element, $f(2)$, \ and so on. Since $f$ is a bijection, for
every element $a$ of $A$, $a$ is the $n$th element enumerated in this
way, for a unique value of $n$. That is, each element of $A$ is
"counted" at some finite stage.

# TODO: if we want to use the diagram, we need to start with zero
# instead of 1. Also, I would prefer having f(0), f(1), f(2), ... in
# the boxes, maybe with an elongated oval around them with the label
# $A$, to indicate that the elements make up the set A.
# We can represent this in a diagram as follows.

With this definition in mind, it is natural to ask the following
question: which of our favorite sets are countable? Is the set of
integers $\ZZ$ countable? How about the rationals $\QQ$, or the reals
$\RR$? What is the logical form of the statement "a set $A$ is not
countable," and how might we prove such a statement? You should think
about these questions before reading on.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* The set of integers, $\ZZ$, is countable.

*Proof.* We need to show that there exists a bijection between $\NN$
 and $\ZZ$. Define $f : \NN \to \ZZ$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
f(n) = \begin{cases}
         n / 2 & \mbox{if $n$ is even} \\
         -(n + 1) / 2 & \mbox{if $n$ is odd}
       \end{cases}    
\end{equation*}
We claim that $f$ is a bijection. To see that it is injective, suppose
$f(m) = f(n)$. If they are nonnegative, then $m$ and $n$ are
even, in which case $m / 2 = n / 2$ implies $m = n$. Otherwise, $m$
and $n$ are odd, and again $-(m+1) / 2 = -(n+1)/ 2$ implies $m = n$.

To see that $f$ is surjective, suppose $a$ is any integer. If $a$ is
nonnegative, then $a = f(a / 2)$. If $a$ is strictly negative, then $2
a - 1$ is also strictly negative, and hence $-(2 a - 1)$ is an odd
natural number. In that case, it is not hard to check that $a =
f(-(2a - 1))$.

We will now build up an arsenal of theorems that we can use to show
that various sets are countable.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* A set $A$ is countable if and only if $A$ is empty or there
is a surjective function $f : \NN \to A$.

*Proof.* For the forward direction, suppose $A$ is countable. Then it
is either finite or countably infinite. If $A$ is countably infinite,
there is a bijection from $\NN$ to $A$, and we are done. Suppose, then,
that $A$ is finite. If $A$ is empty, we are done; otherwise, for some
$n$, there is a bijection $f : [n] \to A$, with $n \geq 1$. Define a
function $g : \NN \to A$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
g(i) = \begin{cases}
         f(i) & \mbox{if $i < n$} \\
         f(0) & \mbox{otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
In other words, $g$ enumerates the elements of $A$ by using $f$ first,
and then repeating the element $f(0)$. Clearly $f$ is surjective, as
required.

In the other direction, if $A$ is finite, then it is countable, and we
are done. So suppose $A$ is not finite. Then it is not empty, and so
there is a surjective function $f : \NN \to A$. We need to turn $f$
into a /bijective/ function. The problem is that $f$ may not be
injective, which is to say, elements in $A$ may be enumerated more
than once. The solution is to define a function, $g$, which eliminates
all the duplicates. The idea is that $g$ should enumerate the elements
$f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots$, but skip over the ones that have already
been enumerated. 

To be precise, the function $g$ is defined recursively as follows:
$g(0) = f(0)$, and for every $i$, $g(i+1) = f(j)$, where $j$ is the
least natural number such that $f(j)$ is not among $\{g(0), g(1),
g(2), \ldots, g(i) \}$. The assumption that $A$ is infinite and $f$ is
surjective guarantees that some such $j$ always exists.

We only need to check that $g$ is a bijection. By definition, for
every $i$, $g(i+1)$ is different from $g(0), \ldots, g(i)$. This
implies that $g$ is injective. But we can also show by induction that
for every $i$, $\{g(0), \ldots, g(i)\} \supseteq \{ f(0), \ldots,
f(i)\}$. Since $f$ is surjective, $g$ is too.
 
#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

In a similar manner to the proof that the integers are countable, we
can prove the following:

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* If $A$ and $B$ are countably infinite, then so is $A \cup
B$.

*Proof.* Suppose $f : \NN \to A$ and $g : \NN \to B$ are
surjective. Then we can define a function $h : \NN \to A
\cup B$:
\begin{equation*}
h(n) = \begin{cases}
         f(n/2) & \mbox{if $n$ is even} \\
         f((n-1)/2) & \mbox{if $n$ is odd}
       \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
It is not hard to show that $h$ is surjective.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Intuitively, if $A = \{ f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots \}$ and $B = \{ g(0),
g(1), g(2), \ldots\}$, then we can enumerate $A \cup B$ as $\{ f(0),
g(0), f(1), g(1), f(2), g(2), \ldots \}$.

The next two theorems are also helpful. The first says that to show
that a set $B$ is countable, it is enough to "cover" it with a
surjective function from a countable set. The second says that to show
that a set $A$ is countable, then it is enough to embed it in a
countable set.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* If $A$ is countable and $f : A \to B$ is surjective, then
$B$ is countable.

*Proof.* If $A$ is countable, then there is a surjective function $g :
\NN \to A$, and $f \circ g$ is a surjective function from $\NN \to B$.

*Theorem.* If $B$ is countable and $f : A \to B$ is injective, then
$A$ is countable.

*Proof.* Assuming $f : A \to B$ is injective, it has a left inverse,
$g : B \to A$. Since $g$ has a right inverse, $f$, we know that $g$ is
surjective, and we can apply the previous theorem.

*Corollary.* If $B$ is countable and $A \subseteq B$, then $A$ is
countable.

*Proof.* The function $f : A \to B$ defined by $f(x) = x$ is
injective.

Remember that $\NN \times \NN$ is the set of ordered pairs $(i, j)$
where $i$ and $j$ are natural numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* $\NN \times \NN$ is countable.

*Proof.* Enumerate the elements as follows:
\begin{equation*}
(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 0), (2, 1), 
  (1, 2), (0, 3), \ldots
\end{equation*}

# TODO: we could use a picture here. 

If you think of the pairs as coordinates in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane, the
pairs are enumerated along diagonals: first the diagonal with pairs
whose elements sum to $0$, then the diagonal with pairs whose elements
sum to $1$, and so on. This is often called a "dovetailing" argument,
because if you imagine drawing a line that weaves back and forth
through the pairs enumerated this ways, it will be analogous to the a
carpenter's practice of using a dovetail to join two pieces of
wood. (And that term, in turn, comes from the similarity to a dove's
tail.)

As far as proofs go, the informal description above and the associated
diagram are perfectly compelling. It is possible to describe a
bijection between $\NN \times \NN$ explicitly, however, in algebraic
terms. You are asked to do this in the exercises.

The previous theorem has a number of interesting consequences.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* If $A$ and $B$ are countable, then so is $A \times B$. 

*Proof.* Let $f : \NN \to \NN \times \NN$ be a surjection, as
guaranteed by the previous theorem, and if $p$ is an element of $\NN
\times \NN$, let $p_0$ and $p_1$ be the two components. Suppose $g :
\NN \to A$ and $h : \NN \to B$ be surjective. Then the function $k(i)
= ( g(f(i)_0), h(f(i)_1) )$ is a surjective function from $\NN$ to $A
\times B$.

*Theorem.* The set of rational numbers, $\QQ$, is countable.

*Proof.* By the previous theorem, we know that $\ZZ \times \ZZ$ is
countable. Define $f : \ZZ \times \ZZ \to \QQ$ by
\begin{equation*}
  f(i,j) = \begin{cases}
             i / j & \mbox{if $j \neq 0$} \\
             0 & \mbox{otherwise}
           \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Since every element of $\QQ$ can be written as $i / j$ for some $i$
and $j$ in $\ZZ$, $f$ is surjective.

*Theorem.* Suppose that $A$ is countable. For each $n$, the set $A^n$
is countable.

*Proof.* Remember that we can identify the set of \(n\)-tuples of
elements from $A$ with $A \times \ldots \times A$, where there are $n$
copies of $A$ in the product. The result follows using induction on
$n$.

*Theorem.* Let $(A_i)_{i \in \NN}$ be a family of sets indexed by the
natural numbers, and suppose that each $A_i$ is countable. Then
$\bigcup_i A_i$ is countable.

*Proof.* Suppose for each $i$, $f_i$ is a surjective function from
$\NN$ to $A_i$. Then the function $g(i, j) = f_i(j)$ is a surjective
function from $\NN$ to $\bigcup_i A_i$.

*Theorem.* Suppose that $A$ is countable. Then the set of finite
sequences of elements of $A$ is countable.

*Proof.* The set of finite sequences of elements of $A$ is equal to
$\bigcup_i A^i$, and we can apply the previous two theorems.

Notice that the set of all alphanumeric characters and punctuation
(say, represented as the set of all ASCII characters) is
finite. Togteher with the last theorem, this implies that there are
only countably many sentences in the English language (and, indeed,
any language in which sentences are represented by finite sequences of
symbols, chosen from any countable stock).

At this stage, it might seem as though everything is countable. In the
next section, we will see that this is not the case: the set of real
numbers, $\RR$, is not countable, and if $A$ is any set (finite or
infinite), the powerset of $A$, ${\mathcal P}(A)$, is not equinumerous
with $A$.

# TODO: This was the previous text. The above is a more streamlined,
# rigorous version; it shows students how to make precise the idea of
# "skipping over duplicates" and "alternating between the two
# enumerations."
#

# The natural numbers and the integers are both "discrete." That is,
# when we draw a number line, there is "space" between each integer; for
# every integer, there are unique integers to its left and its right. We
# used this property in order to come up with our enumeration.

# Since this property is not true of the rational numbers, we might
# hypothesize that $\QQ$ is uncountable. Remarkably, this hypothesis is
# false: we can find a bijection between $\NN$ and $\QQ$. Doing so with
# full mathematical rigor takes a bit of work, so we will first see the
# general idea, and then indicate how to make it more precise.

# Consider the rational numbers laid out in a table as follows:

# # | 1/1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/4 | 1/5 | ... |
# # | 2/1 | 2/2 | 2/3 | 2/4 | 2/5 | ... |
# # | 3/1 | 3/2 | 3/3 | 3/4 | 3/5 | ... |
# # | 4/1 | 4/2 | 4/3 | 4/4 | 4/5 | ... |
# # | 5/1 | 5/2 | 5/3 | 5/4 | 5/5 | ... |
# # | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |     |

# #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 350bp
#  [[./card_diagram_4.png]]

# It should be easy to convince yourself that this table contains every
# positive rational number. (The number $p / q$ occurs in the $p$ th row
# and $q$ th column.) In fact, this table contains many copies of every
# rational number: the number $1$ appears as $1/1$, $2/2$, $3/3$, and so
# on. But this shouldn't matter -- if we can count every entry in this
# table, then we can "skip over" entries that have already been counted,
# and count each positive rational exactly once.

# # | 1/1 ↓ | 1/2 →   | 1/3 ↓ | 1/4 → | 1/5 ↓ | ... |
# # | 2/1 → | 2/2 ↑   | 2/3 ↓ | 2/4 ↑ | 2/5 ↓ | ... |
# # | 3/1 ↓ | 3/2 ←   | 3/3 ← | 3/4 ↑ | 3/5 ↓ | ... |
# # | 4/1 →  | 4/2 →   | 4/3 → | 4/4 ↑ | 4/5 ↓ | ... |
# # | 5/1 ↓ | 5/2 ←   | 5/3 ← | 5/4 ← | 5/5 ← | ... |
# # | ... | ...   | ... | ... | ... |     |

# Once we've agreed that the positive rationals are countable, it is
# easy to extend our argument to the full set of rationals, using the
# same alternating trick we used with $\ZZ$.

# In the case of the integers, it was reasonably easy to come up with a
# formula $f(n)$ that told us exactly which integer corresponded to
# which natural number.  Because of the "double-counting" problem,
# there's no obvious way to come up with a similar formula here. Notice,
# though, that the double-counting problem disappears if we consider
# /ordered pairs/ of natural numbers instead of fractions.  That is,
# instead of writing $2/3$ in the table, we write the pair $(2, 3)$.
# The pair $(2, 2)$ is different from the pair $(3, 3)$, and thus we
# don't have to worry about counting the same fraction twice. Next,
# notice that the positive rational numbers correspond to a /subset/ of
# the set of ordered pairs of naturals: specifically, the rational
# number $p / q$ (in lowest terms) corresponds to the pair $(p,
# q)$. This correspondence is an /injection/: every positive rational
# has a unique ordered pair, but not every ordered pair has a
# corresponding rational.


** Cantor's Theorem

A set $A$ is /uncountable/ if it is not countable. Our goal is to
prove the following theorem, due to Georg Cantor.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* The set of real numbers is uncountable.

*Proof.* Remember that $[0,1]$ denotes the closed interval $\{ r \in
\RR \mid 0 \leq r \leq 1\}$. It suffices to show that there is no
surjective function $f : \NN \to [0,1]$, since if $\RR$ were
countable, $[0,1]$ would be countable too.

Recall that every real number $r \in [0,1]$ has a decimal expansion of
the form $r = 0.r_1 r_2 r_3 r_4 \ldots$, where each $r_i$ is a digit
in $\{0, 1, \ldots, 9\}$. More formally, we can write $r = \sum_{i =
1}^\infty \frac{r_i}{10^{-i}}$ for each $r \in \RR$ with $0 \leq r \leq 1$.

(Remember that $1$ can be written $0.9999\ldots$. In general every
other rational number in $[0,1]$ will have two representations of this
form; for example, $0.5 = 0.5000\ldots = 0.49999\ldots$. For
concreteness, for these numbers we can choose the representation that
ends with zeros.)

As a result, we can write
- $f(0) = 0.r_{0,0} r_{0,1} r_{0,2} r_{0,3} \ldots$
- $f(1) = 0.r_{1,0} r_{1,1} r_{1,2} r_{1,3} \ldots$
- $f(2) = 0.r_{2,0} r_{2,1} r_{2,2} r_{2,3} \ldots$
- $f(3) = 0.r_{3,0} r_{3,1} r_{3,2} r_{3,3} \ldots$
- ...

Our goal is to show that $f$ is not surjective. To that end, define a
new sequence of digits $(r_i)_{i \in \NN}$ by
\begin{equation*}
r_i = \begin{cases}
        7 & \mbox{if $r_{i,i} \neq 7$} \\
        3 & \mbox{otherwise.}
      \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
The define the real number $r = 0.r_0 r_1 r_2 r_3 \ldots$. Then, for
each $i$, $r$ differs from $f(i)$ in the $i$th digit. But this means
that for every $i$, $f(i) \neq r$. Since $r$ is not in the range of $f$, and
hence $f$ is not surjective. Since $f$ was arbitrary, there is no
surjective function from $\NN$ to $[0,1]$.

(We chose the digits $3$ and $7$ only to avoid $0$ and $9$, to avoid
the case where, for example, $f(0) = 0.5000\ldots$ and $r =
0.4999\ldots$. Since there are no zeros or nines in $r$, since the
$i$th digit of $r$ differs from $f(i)$, it really is a different real
number.)

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

This remarkable proof is known as a "diagonalization argument." We are
trying to construct a real number with a certain property, namely,
that it is not in the range of $f$. We make a table of digits, in
which the rows represent infinitely many constraints we have to
satisfy (namely, that for each $i$, $f(i) \neq r$), and the columns
represent opportunities to satisfy that contraint (namely, by choosing
the \(i\)th digit of $r$ appropriately). The complete the construction
by stepping along the diagonal, using the $i$th opportunity to satisfy
the \(i\)th constraint. This technique is used often in logic and
computability theory.

The following provides another example of an uncountable set.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* The power set of the natural numbers, ${\mathcal P}(\NN)$, is
uncountable.

*Proof.* Let $f : \NN \to {\mathcal P}(\NN)$ be any function. Once again,
our goal is to show that $f$ is not surjective. Let $S$ be the set of
natural numbers, defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
S = \{ n \in \NN \mid n \notin f(i) \}
\end{equation*}
In words, for every natural number, $n$, $n$ is in $S$ if and only if
it is not in $f(n)$. Then clearly for every $n$, $f(n) \neq S$. So $f$
is not surjective.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

We can also view this as a diagonalization argument: draw a table with
rows and columns indexed by the natural numbers, where the entry in
the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column is "yes" if $j$ is an element of
$f(i)$, and "no" otherwise. The set $S$ is constructed by switching
"yes" and "no" entries along the diagonal.

In fact, exactly the same argument yields the following:

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* For every set $A$, there is no surjective function from $A$
to ${\mathcal P}(A)$.

*Proof.* As above, if $f$ is any function from $A$ to ${\mathcal P}(A)$,
the set $S = \{ a \in A \mid a \notin f(a) \}$ is not in the range of
$f$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

This shows that there is an endless hierarchy of infinites. For
example, in the sequence $\NN, {\mathcal P}(\NN),
{\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\NN)), \ldots$, there is an injective function
mapping each set into the next, but no surjective function. The union
of all those sets is even larger still, and then we can take the power
set of /that/, and so on. Set theorists are still today investigating
the structure within this hierarchy.

** An Alternative Definition of the Infinite

One thing that distinguishes the infinite from the finite is that and
infinite set can have the same size as a proper subset of itself. For
example, the natural numbers, the set of even numbers, and the set of
perfect squares are all equinumerous, even though the latter two are
strictly contained among the natural numbers. 

In the nineteenth century, the mathematician Richard Dedekind used
this curious property to /define/ what it means to be infinite. We can
show that his definition is equivalent to ours, but the proof requires
the axiom of choice.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* A set is $A$ /Dedekind infinite/ if $A$ is equinumerous
with a proper subset of itself, and finite otherwise.

*Theorem.* A set is Dedekind infinite if and only it is infinite.

*Proof.* Suppose $A$ is Dedekind infinite. We need to show it is not
finite; suppose, to the contrary, it is bijective with $[n]$ for some
$n$. Composing bijections, we have that $[n]$ is bijective with a
proper subset of itself. This means that there is an injective
function $f$ from $[n]$ to a proper subset of $n$. Modifying $f$, we
can get an injective function from $[n]$ into $[n-1]$, contradicting
the pigeonhole principle.

Suppose, on the other hand, that $A$ is infinite. We need to show that
there is an injective function $f$ from $A$ to a proper subset of itself
(because then $f$ is a bijection between $A$ and the range of
$f$). Choose a sequence of distinct element $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ of
$A$. Let $f$ map each $a_i$ to $a_{i+1}$, but leave every other
element of $A$ fixed. Then $f$ is injective$, but $a_0$ is not in the
range of $f$, as required.

Saying that $A$ and $B$ ar equinumerous means, intuitively, that $A$

$A$ is not larger than $B$:

question: does $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq A$ imply $A \approx B$? In
other words, assuming there are injective functions $f : A \to B$ and
$g : B \to A$, is there necessarily a bijection from $A$ to $B$?

The answer is "yes," but the proof is tricky. The result is known as
the /Cantor-Bernstein Theorem/, and we state it without proof.

*Theorem.* For any sets $A$ and $B$, if $A \preceq B$ and $B \preceq
 A$, then $A \approx B$.

** Exercises

1. Show that equinumerosity is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

2. Show that the function $f(x) = x / (1 - x)$ is a bijection between
   the interval $[0,1)$ and $\RR^{\geq 0}$.
  
3. Show that the $g(x) = x / (1 - |x|)$ gives a bijection between
   $(-1, 1)$ and $\RR$.

4. Define a function $J : \NN \times \NN \to \NN$ by 
   $J(i,j) = \frac{(i + j)(i + j + 1)}{2} + i$.

   a. Draw a picture indicating which pairs are sent to $0, 1, 2,
      \ldots$.

   b. Let $n = i + j$. Show that $J(i,j)$ is equal the number of pairs
       $(u, v)$ such that either $u + v < n$, or $u + v = n$
       and $u < i$. (Use the fact that $1 + 2 + \ldots + n = n(n+1)/2$.)

   c. Conclude that $J$ is surjective: to find $i$ and $j$ such that
      $J(i,j) = k$, it suffices to find the largest $n$ such that
      $n(n+1)/2 \leq k$, let $i = k - n(n+1)/2$, and let $j = n - i$.

    d. Conclude that $J$ is injective: if $J(i,j) = J(i',j')$, let $n
       = i + j$ and $n' = i' + j'$. Argue that $n = n'$, and so $i = i'$
       and $j = j'$.

    This shows that $J$ is a bijection from $\NN \times \NN$ to $\NN$.

5. Let $S$ be the set of functions from $\NN$ to $\{ 0, 1\}$.  Use a
   diagonal argument to show that $S$ is uncountable. (Notice that you
   can think of a function $f: \NN \to \{0, 1\}$ as an infinite
   sequence of 0's and 1's, given by $f(0), f(1), f(2), \ldots$. So,
   given a function $F(n)$ which, for each natural number $n$, returns
   an infinite sequence of 0's and 1's, you need to find a sequence
   that is not in the image of $F$.)
  
6. If $f$ and $g$ are functions from $\NN$ to $\NN$, say that $g$
   \emph{eventually dominates} $f$ if there is some $n$ such that for
   every $m \geq n$, $g(m) > f(m)$. In other words, from some point
   on, $g$ is bigger than $f$.

   Show that if $f_0, f_1, f_2, \ldots$ is any sequence of functions
   from $\NN$ to $\NN$, indexed by the natural numbers, then there is
   a function $g$ that eventually dominates each $f_i$.  (Hint:
   construct $g$ so that for each $i$, $g(n) > f_i(n)$ for every $n
   \geq i$.)

7. Show that the relation $\preceq$ defined in [[#The_Cantor-Bernstein_Theorem][Section 29.5]] is
   reflexive and transitive.
