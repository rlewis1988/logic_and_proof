# ** Probability on a Finite Set

# Probability assignments. Example. Events. Disjoint events, and the
# probability law. Independent events.

# In the special case where the outcomes are equally likely, we reduce
# to combinatorics. Examples: cards, dice.


# ** Expectation and Conditional Probability

# Define, again in the finite case, and give some examples.


# ** Probability Spaces

# Issue: we also want to deal with infinite sets, like spinning a
# spinner, or time.

# Definition: algebra. Axioms for probability.

# Examples of some derivations from the axioms for probability.

# (Mention: sigma algebras.)
