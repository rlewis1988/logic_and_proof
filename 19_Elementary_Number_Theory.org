* Elementary Number Theory
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Elementary_Number_Theory
:END:

In the last two chapters, we saw that the natural numbers are
characterized by the fact that they support /proof by induction/ and
/definition by recursion/. Moreover, with these components, we can
actually define $+$, $\times$, and $<$ in a suitable axiomatic
foundation, and prove that they have the relevant properties. In
[[file:17_The_Natural_Numbers_and_Induction.org::#The_Integers][Section 17.1]] we also discussed the integers, which include negative
numbers and support the operation of subtraction.

The natural numbers and the integers are the central components of
/number theory/, a branch of mathematics dating back to the
ancients. In this chapter, we will discuss some of the rudiments of
this subject.

** The Quotient-Remainder Theorem
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: The_Quotient_Remainder_Theorem
:END:

A key property of the integers that we will use here is the
quotient-remainder theorem:

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* Let $n$ and $m$ be integers with $m > 0$. Then there
are integers $q$ and $r$ satisfying $n = m q + r$ and $0 \le r < m$.

*Proof.* First we prove this in the case where $n$ is a natural
number, in which case use complete induction on $n$. Let $n$ be any
natural number. If $n < m$, then we can take $q = 0$ and $r = n$, and
we indeed have $n = m q + r$ and $0 \le r < m$. Otherwise, we have $n
\geq m$. In this case $n - m$ is a natural number smaller than $n$. By
induction hypothesis, we know that we can find $q'$ and $r'$ such that
$n - m = m q' + r'$ and $0 \le r' < m$. Then we can choose $q = q' +
1$ and $r = r'$, and we obtain $n = m q + r$ and $0 \le r < m$, as
desired.

If $n$ is negative, then $-(n+1)$ is a natural number, hence we can
use the previous part for $-(n+1)$ to obtain $q'$ and $r'$ such that
$-(n+1) = m q' + r'$ and $0 \le r' < m$. Now let $q = -(q' + 1)$ and
$r = m - r' - 1$. Then we can compute
\begin{align*}
m q + r &= -m (q' + 1) + m - r' - 1\\
&=  -(m q' + r') - m + m - 1\\
&= -(-(n+1)) - 1\\
&= n + 1 - 1\\
&= n.
\end{align*}
Also, since $r' \geq 0$ we have $r < m$ and since $r' < m$ we have $r
\geq 0$. This completes the proof.

Intuitively, $q$ is the integer /quotient/ when you divide $n$ by $m$
and $r$ is the /remainder/. Remember that using the word "the"
presupposes that there are unique values meeting that
description. That is, in fact, the case:

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Proposition.* If $n$ and $m$ are as above, $n = m q + r$ and $n =
m q' + r'$ with both $r$ and $r'$ less than $n$, then $q = q'$ and $r
= r'$.

*Proof.* By assumption, we have $mq + r = m q' + r'$. It suffices to
show that $q = q'$, because then $m q = m q'$, and hence $r = r'$.

Suppose $q \ne q'$. Then either $q < q'$ or $q' < q$. Suppose without
loss of generality that $q < q'$. (The other case is symmetric.) Then
$m q < m q'$, so we can subtract $mq$ from both sides of the equality
$mq + r = m q' + r'$ to obtain
\[
r = m q' + r - m q = m (q - q') + r'.
\]
But since $q' < q$, we have $q - q' \ge 1$, which means
\[
m (q - q') + r' \ge m + r' \ge m,
\]
which contradicts the fact that $r < m$.

** Divisibility
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Divisibility
:END:

We can define divisibility on the integers as follows.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Given two integers $m$ and $n$. We say that $m$ /is a
 divisor of/ $n$, written $m \mid n$, if there exists some integer $k$
 such that $m \cdot k = n$. We also say that $n$ /is divisible by/ $m$
 or that $m$ /divides/ $n$. We write $m \nmid n$ to say that $m$ is
 not a divisor of $n$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

We can now prove the following:

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* The relation $\mid$ is reflexive and transitive. Also, if
$n \mid m$ and $m \mid n$, then $m = \pm n$. This means that
restricted to the natural numbers, this relation is a partial order.

*Proof.* Reflexivity is immediate, because $n \cdot 1 = n$, hence
$n\mid n$.

For transitivity, suppose $m \mid n$ and $n \mid
r$. Then there are $k,\ell$ such that $m \cdot k = n$ and $n \cdot
\ell = r$. Now we compute
\begin{align*}
m \cdot (k \cdot \ell) &= (m \cdot k) \cdot \ell \\
& = n \cdot \ell  \\
& = r.
\end{align*}

Suppose that $n$ and $m$ are integers such that $n\mid m$ and $m \mid
n$. Then there exist $k$ and $\ell$ such that $n\cdot k = m$ and $m
\cdot \ell = n$. We distinguish two cases. If $n = 0$, then we have $m
= n\cdot k = 0 = n$, so we are done. If $n \neq 0$, then we use the
the equations to get $n \cdot k \cdot \ell = m \cdot \ell = n$, and we
can cancel $n$ on both sides to get $k \cdot \ell = 1$. We conclude
that $k = \ell = \pm 1$, hence we get $m = n \cdot k = \pm n$.

Note that this means that if $n$ and $m$ are both natural numbers,
then $n = m$, which means that $\mid$ is antisymmetric, and hence a
partial order, on the natural numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

See Exercise 1 for some basic properties of divisibility.

An integer is /even/ if it is divisible by $2$, in other words,
$n$ is even if $2 \mid n$. An integer is /odd/ if it's not
even. Of course, odd numbers are of the form $2k+1$ for some $k$, and
we can prove this now.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* If $n$ is an odd integer, then $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k$.

*Proof.* By the quotient-remainder theorem, we can write $n = 2k+r$
for some integers $k$ and $r$ with $0\le r < 2$. The last condition
means that $r = 0$ or $r = 1$. In the first case, we have $n = 2k$,
hence $2 \mid n$, contradicting that $n$ is odd. So we have $r = 1$,
which means that $n = 2k+1$.

*Theorem.* Every sequence of $k$ consecutive numbers contains a number
divisible by $k$.

*Proof.* Denote the largest number of the sequence by $n$. This means
that the sequence is $n - (k - 1), \ldots, n - 1, n$. By the
quotient-remainder theorem, we have $n = q k + r$ for some integers
$q$ and $r$ with $0\leq r < k$. From these inequalities we conclude
that $n - r$ is in our sequence, and $n - r = q k$, hence divisible by
$k$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Given two integers $m$ and $n$ such that either $m \neq
0$ or $n \neq 0$. We define the /greatest common divisor/ $\gcd(m,n)$
of $m$ and $n$ to be the largest integer $d$ which is both a divisor
of $m$ and $n$, that is $d \mid m$ and $d \mid n$.

This largest integer exists, because there is at least one common
divisor, but only finitely many. There is at least one, since 1 is a
common divisor of any two integers, and there are finitely many, since
a nonzero number has only finitely many divisors.

If $n = m = 0$, then we define $\gcd(0,0) = 0$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

The greatest common divisor of two numbers is always a natural number,
since 1 is always a common divisor of two numbers.  As an example, let
us compute the greatest common divisor of 6 and 28. The positive
divisors of 6 are $\{1, 2, 3, 6\}$ and the positive divisors of 28 are
$\{1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28\}$. The largest number in both these sets is 2,
which is the greatest common divisor of 6 and 28.

However, computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers by
listing all the divisors of both numbers is a lot of work, so we will
now consider a method to compute the greatest common divisor more
efficiently.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Lemma.* For all integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ we have
$\gcd(n,m)=\gcd(m,n-km)$.

*Proof.* Let $d = \gcd(n,m)$ and $r = n-km$. If $n = m = 0$, then $d
= 0 = \gcd(m,r)$, and we're done.

In the other case we first show that the set of common divisors of $n$
and $m$ is the same as the set of the common divisors of $m$ and
$r$. To see this, let $d' \mid m$ and $d' \mid n$. Then also $d' \mid
n - km$ by Exercise 1 below. Hence $d'$ is a common divisor of $m$
and $r$. On the other hand, if $d'$ is a divisor of $n$ and $r$, then
$d' \mid r + km$, hence $d' \mid n$, hence $d'$ is a common divisor
of $n$ and $m$.

Since the sets of common divisors are the same, the largest element
in each set is also the same, hence $\gcd(n,m)=\gcd(m,n-km)$.

*Lemma.* For all integers $n$ we have $\gcd(n,0)=|n|$.

*Proof.* Every number is a divisor of 0, hence the greatest common
divisor of $n$ and 0 is just the greatest divisor of $n$, which is
the absolute value of $n$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

These two lemmas give us a quick way to compute the greatest common
divisor of two numbers. This is called the /Euclidean
Algorithm/. Suppose we want to compute $\gcd(a, b)$.

- We let $r_0 = a$ and $r_1 = b$.
- Given $r_n$ and $r_{n+1}$ we compute $r_{n+2}$ as the remainder of
  of $r_n$ when divided by $r_{n+1}$.
- Once $r_n = 0$, we stop, and $\gcd(a, b) = |r_{n-1}|$.

This works, because by the lemmas above, we have $\gcd(r_k,r_{k+1}) =
\gcd(r_{k+1}, r_{k+2})$, since $r_{k+2} = r_k - qr_{k+1}$ for some
$q$. Hence if $r_n=0$ we have
$\gcd(a,b)=\gcd(r_0,r_1)=\gcd(r_{n-1},r_n)=\gcd(r_{n-1},0)=|r_{n-1}|$

For example, suppose we want to compute the greatest common divisor of
1311 and 5757. We compute the following remainders:
\begin{align*}
5757 &= 4\times1311 + 513\\
1311 &= 2\times513 + 285\\
513 &= 1\times285 + 228\\
285 &= 1\times228 + 57\\
228 &= 4\times57 + 0.
\end{align*}
Hence $\gcd(1311,5757) = 57$. This is much quicker than computing all
the divisors of both 1311 and 5757.

Here is an important result about greatest common divisors. It is only
called a "lemma" for historical reasons.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem* (B‎ézout's Lemma). Let $n$ and $m$ be integers. Then there
are integers $a$ and $b$ such that $an+bm=\gcd(n,m)$.

*Proof.* We compute $\gcd(n,m)$ by the Euclidean Algorithm given
above, and during the algorithm we get the intermediate values $r_0,
r_1, \ldots, r_n$ where $r_n = 0$. Now by induction on $k$ we prove
that we can write $r_k = a_kn+b_km$ for some integers $a_k$ and
$b_k$. Indeed: $r_0 = 1\cdot n + 0\cdot m$ and $r_1 = 0\cdot n +
1\cdot m$. Now if we assume that $r_k = a_kn+b_km$ and $r_{k+1} =
a_{k+1}n+b_{k+1}m$, we know that $r_{k+2} = r_k - q\cdot r_{k+1}$,
where $q$ is the quotient of $r_k$ when divided by $r_{k+1}$. These
equations together give
\begin{equation*}
r_{k+2} = (a_k-qa_{k+1})n + (b_k-qb_{k+1})m
\end{equation*}
This completes the induction. In particular, $r_{n-1} =
a_{n-1}n+b_{n-1}m$, and since $\gcd(n,m)=\pm r_{n-1}$ we can write
$\gcd(n,m)$ as $an+bm$ for some $a$ and $b$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Corollary.* If $c$ is any common divisor of $n$ and $m$, then $c \mid
\gcd(n, m)$.

*Proof.* By B‎ézout's Lemma, there are $a$ and $b$ such that
$\gcd(n,m)=an+bm$. Since $c$ divides both $n$ and $m$, $c$ divides
$an+bm$ by Exercise 1 below, and hence also $\gcd(n,m)$.

Of special interest are pairs of integers which have no divisors in
common, except 1 and $-1$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* Two integers $n$ and $m$ are /coprime/ if $\gcd(n,m) = 1$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Proposition.* Let $n$, $m$ and $k$ be integers such that $n$ and $k$
are coprime. If $k \mid nm$ then $k \mid m$

*Proof.* By B‎ézout's Lemma, there are $a$ and $b$ such that $an+bk =
1$. Multiplying by $m$ gives $anm + bkm = m$ Since $k$ divides $nm$,
$k$ divides the left-hand side of the equation, hence $k \mid m$.

** Prime Numbers
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Modular_Arithmetic
:END:

In this section we consider properties of prime numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* An integer $p\geq 2$ is called /prime/ if the only
positive divisors of $p$ are 1 and $p$. An integer $n \geq 2$ which
is not prime is called /composite/.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

An equivalent definition of a prime number is a positive number with
exactly 2 positive divisors.

Recall from [[file:17_The_Natural_Numbers_and_Induction.org][Chapter 17]] that every natural number greater than 1 can be
written as the product of primes. In particular, ever natural number
greater than 1 is divisible by some prime number.

We now prove some other properties about prime numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* There are infinitely many primes.

*Proof.* Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there are only
finitely many primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$. Let $n = p_1
\times p_2 \times \cdots \times p_k$. Since $n$ is divisible by $p_i$
for all $i\leq k$ we know that $n+1$ is not divisible by $p_i$ for
any $i$. However, we assumed that these are all primes, contradicting the
fact that every number is divisible by a prime number.

*Lemma.* If $n$ is an integer and $p$ is a prime number, then either $n$
and $p$ are coprime or $p \mid n$.

*Proof.* Let $d = \gcd(n, p)$. Since $d$ is a positive divisor of
$p$, either $d = 1$ or $d = p$. In the first case, $n$ and $p$ are
coprime by definition, and in the second case we have $p \mid n$.

*Proposition.* If $n$ and $m$ are integers and $p$ is a prime number such
that $p \mid nm$ then either $p \mid n$ or $p \mid m$.

*Proof.* Suppose that $p \nmid n$. By the previous Lemma, this means
that $p$ and $n$ are coprime. From this we can conclude that $p \mid m$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

The last result in this section captures that the primes are the
"building blocks" of the positive integers for multiplication: all
other integers can be written as a product of primes in an
essentially unique way.


#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem* (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Let $n > 0$ be an
integer. Then there are primes $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ such that $n =
p_1\times \cdots \times p_k$. Moreover, these primes are unique up to
reordering. That means that if there are prime numbers $q_1, \ldots,
q_\ell$ such that $q_1\times \cdots \times q_\ell = n$, then the $q_i$
are a reordering of the $p_i$. To be completely precise, this means
that there is a bijection $\sigma : \{1, \ldots, k\} \to \{1, \ldots,
k\}$ such that $q_i = p_{\sigma(i)}$.

*Remark.* 1 can be written as the product of zero prime numbers. The
/empty product/ is defined to be 1.

*Proof.* We have already seen that every number can be written as the
product of primes, so we only need to prove the uniqueness up to
reordering. Suppose this is not true, and by the least element
principle, let $n$ be the smallest positive integers such that $n$ can
be written as the product of primes in two ways: $n = p_1\times \cdots
\times p_k = q_1 \times \cdots \times q_\ell$.

Since 1 can be written as product of primes /only/ as empty product,
we have $n > 1$, hence $k \geq 1$. Since $p_k$ is prime, we must have
$p_k \mid q_j$ for some $j \leq \ell$. By swapping $q_j$ and $q_\ell$,
we may assume that $j = \ell$. Since $q_\ell$ is also prime, we have
$p_k = q_\ell$.

Now we have $p_1\times \cdots \times p_{k-1} = q_1 \times
\cdots \times q_{\ell-1}$. This product is smaller than $n$, but can
be written as product of primes in two different ways. But we assumed
$n$ was the smallest such number. Contradiction!

** Modular Arithmetic
:PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Modular_Arithmetic
:END:

In the discussion of equivalence relations in [[file:13_Relations.org::#Equivalence_Relations_and_Equality][Section 13.3]] we considered
the example of the relation of modular equivalence on the
integers. This is sometimes thought of as "clock arithmetic." Suppose
you have a 12-hour clock without a minute hand, so it only has an hour
hand which can point to the hours 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11 and then it wraps to 12 again. We can do arithmetic with this
clock.
- If the hand currently points to 10, then 5 hours later it will point to 3.
- If the hand points to 7, then 23 hours before that, it pointed to 8.
- If the hand points to 9, and we work for a 8 hours, then when we are
  done the hand will point to 5. If we worked twice as long, starting
  at 9, the hand will point to 1.

We want to write these statements using mathematical notation, so that
we can reason about them more easily. We cannot write $10 + 5 = 3$ for
the first expression, because that would be false, so instead we use
the notation $10 + 5 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}$. The notation $\pmod{12}$
indicates that we forget about multiples of 12, and we use the
"congruence" symbol with three horizontal lines to remind us that
these values are not exactly equal, but only equal up to multiples
of 12. The other two lines can be formulated as $7 - 23 \equiv 8
\pmod{12}$ and $9 + 2 \cdot 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}$.

Here are some more examples:
- $6 + 7 \equiv 1 \pmod{12}$
- $6 \cdot 7 \equiv 42 \equiv 6 \pmod{12}$
- $7 \cdot 5 \equiv 35 \equiv -1 \pmod{12}$
The last example shows that we can use negative numbers as well.

We now give a precise definition.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Definition.* For integers $a$, $b$ and $n$ we say that $a$ and $b$
are /congruent modulo/ $n$ if $n \mid a - b$. This is written $a
\equiv b \pmod{n}$. The number $n$ is called the /modulus/.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

Typically we only use this definition when the modulus $n$ is
positive.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* Congruence modulo $n$ is an equivalence relation.

*Proof.* We have to show that congruence modulo $n$ is reflexive,
symmetric and transitive.

It is reflexive, because $a - a = 0$, so $n \mid a - a$, and hence
$a\equiv a \pmod{n}$.

To show that it is symmetric, suppose that $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$. Then
by definition, $n \mid a - b$. So $n \mid (-1) \cdot (a - b)$, which
means that $n \mid b - a$. This means by definition that $b \equiv a
\pmod{n}$.

To show that it is transitive, suppose that $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ and
$b \equiv c \pmod{n}$. Then we have $n \mid a - b$ and $n \mid b -
c$. Hence we have $n \mid (a - b) + (b - c)$ which means that $n \mid
a - c$. So $a \equiv c \pmod{n}$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

This theorem justifies the "chaining" notation we used above when we
wrote $7 \cdot 5 \equiv 35 \equiv -1 \pmod{12}$. Since congruence
modulo 12 is transitive, we can now actually conclude that $7\cdot
5\equiv -1 \pmod{12}$.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* Suppose that $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$ and $c\equiv
d\pmod{n}$. Then $a+c\equiv b+d \pmod{n}$ and $a\cdot c\equiv b\cdot
d\pmod{n}$.

Moreover, if $a\equiv b \pmod{n}$ then $a^k\equiv b^k \pmod{n}$ for
all natural numbers $k$.

*Proof.* We know that $n \mid a - b$ and $n \mid c - d$. For the first
statement, we can calculate that $(a + c) - (b + d) = (a - b) + (c -
d)$, so we can conclude that $n \mid (a + c) - (b + d)$ hence that
$a+c\equiv b+d\pmod{n}$.

For the second statement, we want to show that $n \mid a\cdot c -
b\cdot d$. We can factor $a\cdot c - b\cdot d = (a - b)\cdot c +
b\cdot(c-d)$. Now $n$ divides both summands on the right, hence $n$
divides $a\cdot c - b\cdot d$, which means that $a\cdot c\equiv b\cdot
d\pmod{n}$.

The last statement follows by induction on $k$. If $k = 0$, then
$1\equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, and for the induction step, suppose that
$a^k\equiv b^k\pmod{n}$, then we have
$a^{k+1}= a\cdot a^k \equiv b \cdot b^k = b^{k+1} \pmod{n}$

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

This theorem is useful for carrying out computations modulo $n$. Here
are some examples.
- Suppose we want to compute $77 \cdot 123$ modulo 12. We know that
  $77 \equiv 5 \pmod{12}$ and $123 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}$, so $77 \cdot
  123 \equiv 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 3 \pmod{12}$
- Suppose we want to compute $99 \cdot 998$ modulo 10. We know that
  $99 \equiv -1\pmod{10}$ and $998 \equiv -2 \pmod{10}$, hence $99
  \cdot 998 \equiv (-1) \cdot (-2) \equiv 2 \pmod{10}$.
- Suppose we want to know the last digit of $101^{101}$. Notice that
  the last digit of a number $n$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 10, so we
  can just compute $101^{101} \equiv 1^{101} \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$. So
  the last digit of $101^{101}$ is 1.

*Warning.* You cannot do all computations you might expect with
modular arithmetic:
- You are not allowed to divide congruent numbers in modular
  arithmetic. For example $12 \equiv 16 \pmod{4}$, but we are not
  allowed to divide both sides of the equation by 2, because $6
  \not\equiv 8 \pmod{4}$.
- You are not allowed to compute in exponents with modular
  arithmetic. For example $8 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, but $2^8 \not\equiv
  2^3 \pmod{5}$. To see this: $2^8 = 256 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, but $2^3
  = 8 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$.

Recall the quotient-remainder theorem: if $n > 0$, then any integer
$a$ can be expressed as $a = n q + r$, where $0 \le r < n$. In the
language of modular arithmetic this means that $a \equiv r
\pmod{n}$. So if $n > 0$, then every integer is congruent to a number
between 0 and $n-1$ (inclusive). So there "are only $n$ different
numbers" when working modulo $n$. This can be used to prove many
statements about the natural numbers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Proposition.* For every integer $k$, $k^2+1$ is not divisible by 3.

*Proof.* Translating this problem to modular arithmetic, we have to
show that $k^2+1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ or in other words that
$k^2\not\equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ for all $k$. By the quotient-remainder
theorem, we know that $k$ is either congruent to 0, 1 or 2,
modulo 3. In the first case, $k^2\equiv 0^2\equiv 0\pmod{3}$. In the
second case, $k^{2}\equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, and in the last case
we have $k^{2}\equiv2^2\equiv4\equiv1\pmod{3}$. In all of those cases,
$k^2\not\equiv2\pmod{3}$. So $k^2+1$ is never divisible by 3.

*Proposition.* For all integers $a$ and $b$, $a^2+b^2-3$ is not
divisible by 4.

*Proof.* We first compute the squares modulo 4. We compute
\begin{align*}
0^2&\equiv 0\pmod{4}\\
1^2&\equiv 1\pmod{4}\\
2^2&\equiv 0\pmod{4}\\
3^2&\equiv 1\pmod{4}
\end{align*}
Since every number is congruent to 0, 1, 2 or 3 modulo 4, we know that
every square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. This means that there
are only four possibilities for $a^2+b^2\pmod{4}$. It can be congruent
to $0+0$, $1+0$, $0+1$ or $0+0$. In all those cases,
$a^2+b^2\not\equiv 3\pmod{4}$ Hence $4\nmid a^2+b^2-3$, proving the
proposition.

Recall that we warned you about dividing in modular arithmetic. This
doesn't always work, but often it does. For example, suppose we want
to solve $2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. We cannot solve this by saying that
$n \equiv \frac12 \pmod{5}$, because we cannot work with fractions in
modular arithmetic. However, we can still solve it by multiplying
both sides with 3. Then we get $6n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, and since
$6\equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ we get $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. So instead of
dividing by 2 we could multiply by 3 to get the answer. The reason
this worked is because $2\times 3\equiv 1\pmod{5}$.

*Definition.* Let $n$ and $a$ be integers. A /multiplicative inverse
of $a$ modulo $n$/ is an integer $b$ such that $ab \equiv 1\pmod{n}$.

For example, 3 is a multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7, since
$3\times 5\equiv1\pmod{7}$. But $2$ has no multiplicative inverse
modulo 6. Indeed, suppose that $2b\equiv 1 \pmod{6}$, then $6 \mid
2b-1$. However, $2b-1$ is odd, and cannot be divisible by an even
number. We can use multiplicative inverses to solve equations. If we
want to solve $ax\equiv c \pmod{n}$ for $x$ and we know that $b$ is a
multiplicative inverse of $a$, the solution is $x\equiv bc \pmod{n}$
which we can see by multiplying both sides by $b$.

*Lemma* Let $n$ and $a$ be integers. $a$ has at most one
multiplicative inverse modulo $n$. That is, if $b$ and $b'$ are both
multiplicative inverses of $a$ modulo $n$, then $b\equiv b'\pmod{n}$.

*Proof.* Suppose that $ab\equiv 1 \equiv ab' \pmod{n}$. Then we can
compute $bab'$ in two ways: $b \equiv b(ab') = (ba)b' \equiv b' \pmod{n}$.

*Proposition.* Let $n$ and $a$ be integers. $a$ has a multiplicative
inverse modulo $n$ if and only if $n$ and $a$ are coprime.

*Proof.* Suppose $b$ is a multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo
$n$. Then $n \mid ab - 1$. Let $d = \gcd(a, b)$. Since $d \mid n$ we
have $d \mid ab-1$. But since $d$ is a divisor of $ab$, we have $d
\mid ab - (ab-1) = 1$. Since $d\geq0$ we have $d=1$. Hence $n$ and
$a$ are coprime.

On the other hand, suppose that $n$ and $a$ are coprime. By B‎ézout's
Lemma we know that there are integers $b$ and $c$ such that
$cn+ba=\gcd(n,a)=1$. We can rewrite this to $ab - 1 = (-c)n$, hence
$n \mid ab - 1$, which means by definition $ab \equiv 1
\pmod{n}$. This means that $b$ is a multiplicative inverse of $a$
modulo $n$.

Note that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is a integer not divisible
by $p$, then $a$ and $p$ are coprime, hence $a$ has a multiplicative
inverse.

Mathematicians from ancient times have been interested in the question
as to which integers can be written as a sum of two squares. For
example, we can write $2 = 1^1 + 1^1$, $5 = 2^2 + 1^2$, $13 = 3^2 +
2^2$. If we make a sufficiently long list of these, an interesting
pattern emerges: if two numbers can be written as a sum of two
squares, then so can their product. For example, $10 = 5 \cdot 2$, and
we can write $10 = 3^2 + 1^2$. Or $65 = 13 \cdot 5$, and we can write
$65 = 8^2 + 1^2$.

At first, one might wonder whether this is just a coincidence. The
following provides a proof of the fact that it is not.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* Let $x$ and $y$ be any two integers. If $x$ and $y$ are
both sums of two squares, then so is $x y$.

*Proof.* Suppose $x = a^2 + b^2$, and suppose $y = c^2 + d^2$. I claim
that
\begin{equation*}
xy = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2.
\end{equation*}
To show this, notice that on the one hand we have
\begin{equation*}
xy = (a^2 + b^2) (c^2 + d^2) = a^2 c^2 + a^2 d^2 + b^2 c^2 + b^2 d^2.
\end{equation*}
On the other hand, we have
\begin{align*}
(ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2 & = (a^2c^2 - 2abcd + b^2 d^2) + (a^2 d^2 + 2 a b c d + b^2 c^2) \\
  & = a^2 c^2 + b^2 d^2 + a^2 d^2 + b^2 c^2.
\end{align*}
Up to the order of summands, the two right-hand sides are the same.

We will now prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is not a fraction of two integers.

#+HTML: <hr>
#+LATEX: \horizontalrule

*Theorem.* There are no integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\frac ab=\sqrt{2}$.

*Proof.* Suppose that $\frac ab=\sqrt{2}$ for some integers $a$ and
$b$. By canceling common factors, we may assume that $a$ and $b$ are
coprime. By squaring both sides, we get $\frac{a^2}{b^2}=2$, and
multiplying both sides by $b^2$ gives $a^2=2b^2$. Since $2b^2$ is
even, we know that $a^2$ is even, and since odd squares are odd, we
conclude that $a$ is even. Hence we can write $a = 2c$ for some
integer $c$. This means that $(2c)^2=2b^2$, hence $2c^2=b^2$. The same
reasoning shows that $b$ is even. But we assumed that $a$ and $b$ are
coprime, which contradicts the fact that they are both even.

Hence there are no integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\frac ab=\sqrt{2}$.
