Mathematicians often strive for abstraction, trying to prove theorems with as few hypotheses
as possible. This is often for pragmatic reasons: a theorem with fewer (or weaker) hypotheses will apply
to more situations and require less work to use. Other times, it is for aesthetic reasons:
mathematicians are curious to know how generally a certain result holds, and if there is a
clean way to characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions.

This desire for abstraction led mathematicians, over centuries, to identify certain kinds
of structures that appear again and again. While the /concrete/ instances of these
structures may be quite different --
for example, the set of integers, the set of isomorphisms from a set to itself, and the set
of symmetries of a cube -- they share certain high-level properties of interest. Using
terminology you've seen already, these structures are all /models/ for one particular theory.

The study of these fundamental structures and their models is called /algebra/, or sometimes /abstract
algebra/ to distinguish it from the algebra learned in school.

** Groups

One of the most common and fundamental algebraic structures is the /group/. A group is a set
$G$ that has a special element $e$, a binary operation $\cdot$ (with codomain $G$), and a unary operation $inv$
(usually written in postfix notation, $^{-1}$). Rather than describing $inv$ as a unary function,
we often describe it by saying "for every element $g \in G$, we have an associated element $g^{-1}$."

Having these attributes alone isn't enough to make a group. The operations and constant need
to satisfy certain axiomatic properties:

- $\cdot$ is associative -- for any $f, g, h \in G$, $(f \cdot g) \cdot h = f \cdot (g \cdot h)$
- $e$ is nilpotent -- for any $g \in G$, $e \cdot g = g \cdot e = g$
- inverses cancel -- for any $g \in G$, $g \cdot g^{-1} = g^{-1} \cdot g = e$

Notice that we have just defined a first-order $L$-structure and theory. A bit more formally: a
group is a model for the theory with constant $e$, function symbols $\cdot$ and $^{-1}$, and axioms

- $\forall f \forall g \forall h ((f \cdot g) \cdot h = f \cdot (g \cdot h))$
- $\forall g (e \cdot g = g \wedge g \cdot e = g)$
- $\forall g (g \cdot g^{-1} = e \wedge g^{-1} \cdot g = e)$

(A brief but important aside: we often write "let G be a group," but since we have defined a group to be a
model of a particular structure, this isn't quite right. Technically, a group is a set $G$ bundled
with the identity element and multiplication and inverse operations. Often, though, these operations
are implicit, or we just use the notation $e$, $\cdot$ and $\inv$. In these cases, "let G be a group" is shorthand
for "let $\langle G, e, \cdot, \inv \rangle$ be a group.")

What are some examples of groups? There are many -- remember that, even though we use the symbol $\cdot$
for the binary group operation and $^{-1}$ for the inverse operation, our concrete groups do not
need to use this notation.

- The integers $\ZZ$ form a group when $\cdot$ is interpreted as addition, $inv$ as negation, and $e$ as $0$.
  It is easy to check that the group axioms hold: e.g., for any $g \in \ZZ$, $g + (-g) = 0$.
- Similarly, the rational numbers $\QQ$ also form a group using addition, negation, and $0$.
- Take our domain to again be $\QQ$. When we interpret $\cdot$ as multiplication, $e$ as $1$, and $inv$ as
  reciprocation (that is, $(\frac{a}{b})^{-1} = \frac{b}{a}$),  we do /not/ get a group. Why not? The inverse we have
  defined here is not a total function -- there is no value set yet for $0^{-1}$. Of course, we could always
  pick an arbitrary value for this (say, $0$), but the value must satisfy our third axiom
  $0 \cdot 0^{-1} = 1 \wedge 0^{-1} \cdot 0 = 1$. Since there is no value we can multiply by $0$ to get 1,
  this cannot hold. So we cannot define a group using multiplication over all of $\QQ$.
- However, the interpretation above works perfectly well if we choose the domain $\QQ \setminus \{0\}$, the
  set of rationals excluding 0.
- Let $S_n = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}$, and think of this set as coming "in order." A /permutation/ of $S_n$ is a
  shuffling of the order of its elements. For example, "flipping the first two elements" is a permutation;
  applying this permutation to $S_n$ gives the ordered set $\{2, 1, 3, \ldots, n\}$. Permutations can be composed:
  given two permutations, do the first shuffle, and then do the second shuffle to the resulting set. There is a
  nilpotent permutation, which doesn't move any elements at all; composing this permutation with a second is the same
  as just applying the second. And permutations can be "undone," by "reversing" the shuffle. This is a (partial, informal)
  argument that the set of permutations of $S_n$ forms a group. How could we make the notion of a "shuffle" more precise?
  How would we show, formally, that this set does form a group?

On the surface, these concrete groups look very different: the set of permutations of $S_n$ seems
nothing like the set of integers. But some properties, consequences of the group axioms, hold in every group.

--------------------------
*Theorem.* Let $G$ be a group. The identity element $e \in G$ is unique. That is: if for some element $e' \in G$,
we have $\forall g (e' \cdot g = g \wedge g \cdot e' = g)$, then $e' = e$.

*Proof.* Applying our hypothesis, we see that $e' \cdot e = e$. Applying the nilpotency axiom, we see that
$e' \cdot e = e'$. Therefore, by the symmetry and transitivity of equality, e' = e.

# Multiply both sides by $e^{-1}$ on the right, to get
# $(e' \cdot e) \cdot e^{-1} = e \cdot e^{-1}$. Using the inverse axiom, the right hand side is equal to $e$:
# $(e' \cdot e) \cdot e^{-1} = e. Using the associativity axiom, the left hand side is equal to e' \cdot (e \cdot e^{-1}),
# which is equal to $e' \cdot e$ (by the inverse axiom), which is equal to $e'$ (by nilpotency). So we have derived $e' = e$.
--------------------------
--------------------------
*Theorem.* Let $G$ be a group. For each $g \in G$, $g\inv$ is unique. That is: If for some element $h \in G$,
we have $g\cdot h = e \wedge h \cdot g = e$, then $h = g\inv$.

*Proof.* If $g \cdot h = e$, then $g\inv \cdot (g \cdot h) = g\inv \cdot h = g\inv$. By associativity, the right hand side
is equal to $(g\inv \cdot g) \cdot h = e \cdot h = h$, so we have $h = g\inv$.
--------------------------

Suppose that $G$ is a group and $g \in G$. For a positive integer $n$, we write $g^n$ as shorthand for
$g \cdot g \cdot \ldots \cdot g$, where $g$ is repeated $n$ times. (We can extend this notation to allow $n$ to be any
integer: $g^0 = e$ and $g^{-n} = (g\inv)^n$ when $n$ is positive.) The /order/ of $g$ is the smallest positive integer
$n$ such that $g^n = e$, if such an $n$ exists. (Can you think of an example of a group $G$ and an element $g \in G$ with
infinite order?)

--------------------------
*Theorem.* Let $G$ be a finite group. Every $g \in G$ has finite order, and this order is at most the cardinality of $G$.

*Proof.* We examine the sequence of group elements $g, g^2, g^3, \ldots$. Since $G$ is finite, these elements cannot
all be different: there are some positive $k$ and $l$, with $k > l$, such that $g^k = g^{k - l}$. We may assume that $k$
is the smallest value for which we can find an $l$ with this property. (This is just to say that $g^k$ is the first "repeat"
occurrence of an element of the sequence.) Note also that $k \le |G| + 1$, since we cannot go more than $|G|$ steps
without a repeat; therefore $l \le |G|$.

We have that $g^{k - l}\cdot g^l = g^k = g^{k - l}$, and similarly $g^l \cdot g^{k - l} = g^l$. Since we have shown that
in every group the identity $e$ is unique, this implies that $g^l = e$. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to argue
that $l$ is the smallest number for which this is true. Therefore, the order of $g$ is $l \le |G|$.
--------------------------

** Fields

Another very important algebraic structure is the /field/. The notion of a field /extends/ that of a group -- that is, a field
is a group with some additional properties.

Let $F$ be a set, $0, 1 \in F$, $add, mul$ be binary operations on $F$, and $neg, inv$ be unary operations on $F$.
We will use the infix notation $+$ and $\cdot$ for $add$ and $mul$, the prefix notation $-$ for neg, and the postfix
notation $\inv$ for $inv$. We say that $F$ is a field if the following conditions hold:
- $\langle F, 0, +, - \rangle$ forms a group
- $\langle F \setminus \{0\}, 1, \cdot, \inv \rangle$ forms a group
- The operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are commutative: for all $a, b \in F$, $a + b = b + a$ and $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
- Multiplication distributes over addition: for all $a, b, c \in F$, $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c).

This description may seem a bit opaque, but once again, there are many familiar examples of fields. We argued earlier that
the first two bullet points hold for the rationals $\QQ$, under the obvious interpretation;
it is easy to confirm that the second two bullets hold as well. Similarly, the obvious interpretation on the reals $\RR$
forms a field.

There are also less familiar examples of fields. Let $F = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$, and define $+$ and $\cdot$ as binary functions
on $F$ using modular arithmetic. (That is: if $a + b \ge 5$ when $a$ and $b$ are considered as natural numbers, we define
$a + b$ on $F$ to be the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by 5.) One can show the existence of additive and multiplicative
inverses on $F$, and distributivity follows from distributivity on $\NN$; therefore this structure forms a field.
In fact, for any prime $p$, the set $F = \{0, 1, \ldots, p - 1\}$ forms a field.

There are many situations in mathematics that seem to "require" real numbers: consider a vector space, for example,
whose objects can be stretched or compressed by any factor $r \in \RR$. Often, there is nothing essential about $\RR$ in
these situations. The rationals $\QQ$ might work just as well; sometimes, it is just the field operations and axioms
that are needed. Other times, perhaps a field with additional properties -- an ordering of the elements, or a norm --
is required. The power of algebraic reasoning allows us to specify, axiomatically, exactly which properties we need. We
avoid being unnecessarily specific in our definitions and theorems, and the fact that they hold for a particular structure
(say, $\RR$) is a simple consequence of the fact that the structure forms a field.
